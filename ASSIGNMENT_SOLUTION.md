## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Error Handling and Failure Scenarios

The script handles numerous failure scenarios:

1. **SSH Authentication Failures**
   ```python
   def setup_ssh_config(self) -> bool:
       # Tests SSH connection to GitHub
       # Provides clear error messages if keys are missing
       # Validates authentication before proceeding
   ```

2. **Repository Access Issues**
   ```python
   def clone_repository(self) -> bool:
       # Handles permission denied errors
       # Implements timeout for slow connections
       # Provides detailed error messages
   ```

3. **JAR File Location Issues**
   ```python
   def verify_jar_file(self) -> bool:
       # Searches for JAR files if not found at expected location
       # Validates JAR file integrity
       # Provides alternative paths
   ```

4. **Port Conflicts**
   ```python
   def check_port_availability(self) -> bool:
       # Detects processes using port 9000
       # Attempts graceful termination
       # Force kills if necessary
   ```

5. **Application Startup Failures**
   ```python
   def start_java_application(self) -> bool:
       # Monitors process health
       # Captures stdout/stderr for debugging
       # Implements restart logic
   ```

### Comprehensive Logging

The script implements detailed logging at multiple levels:

- **INFO Level:** Progress updates and successful operations
- **WARNING Level:** Non-critical issues that don't stop deployment
- **ERROR Level:** Critical failures requiring attention
- **DEBUG Level:** Detailed troubleshooting information

Example log output:
```
2025-01-28 10:30:15 - INFO - Starting deployment process...
2025-01-28 10:30:16 - INFO - ‚úì SSH connection to GitHub successful
2025-01-28 10:30:45 - INFO - ‚úì Repository cloned successfully
2025-01-28 10:30:46 - INFO - ‚úì JAR file verified at: build/libs/project.jar
2025-01-28 10:30:47 - INFO - ‚úì Java application started with PID: 1234
```

### Load Balancer Configuration

#### Parameters Set and Reasoning:

1. **Load Balancer Type: Application (ALB)**
   - **Why:** Layer 7 routing capabilities for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
   - **Benefit:** Advanced routing, SSL termination, WAF integration

2. **Health Check Configuration:**
   ```hcl
   health_check {
     enabled             = true
     healthy_threshold   = 2      # Quick recovery
     unhealthy_threshold = 3      # Avoid false positives
     timeout             = 10     # Generous for network latency
     interval            = 30     # Standard AWS recommendation
     path                = "/health"
     matcher             = "200"
   }
   ```

3. **Auto Scaling Thresholds:**
   - **CPU Target: 70%** - Allows headroom for traffic spikes
   - **Memory Target: 80%** - More predictable than CPU usage
   - **Min Capacity: 2** - Ensures high availability
   - **Max Capacity: 10** - Prevents runaway costs

4. **Security Groups:**
   - **ALB:** Allows HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from internet
   - **ECS:** Only allows traffic from ALB on port 9000
   - **Principle:** Least privilege access

#### Parameters Not Set (and why):

1. **SSL Certificate:** Not configured by default
   - **Reason:** Requires domain ownership and certificate provisioning
   - **Alternative:** Can be added via `certificate_arn` variable

2. **WAF Integration:** Not included
   - **Reason:** Adds complexity and cost for basic deployment
   - **Alternative:** Can be added as separate resource

3. **Custom Domain:** Uses AWS-generated DNS
   - **Reason:** Domain setup requires external DNS configuration
   - **Alternative:** Route53 integration can be added

## üéØ Assumptions and Decisions

### Technical Assumptions Made:

1. **Repository Structure:**
   - JAR file located at `build/libs/project.jar`
   - Repository is publicly accessible via SSH
   - Application follows standard Java web application patterns

2. **Application Behavior:**
   - Listens on port 9000 (as specified)
   - Exposes health endpoint at `/health`
   - Uses standard JVM startup parameters

3. **AWS Environment:**
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
   - VPC and subnets can be created
   - ECR repository access available

4. **Security Model:**
   - SSH keys managed outside of containers
   - Environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - IAM roles for AWS resource access

### Design Decisions Made:

1. **Python for Deployment Script**
   - **Why:** Better error handling and logging than shell scripts
   - **Alternative:** Bash script (simpler but less robust)

2. **ECS Fargate over EC2**
   - **Why:** Serverless container management, no infrastructure overhead
   - **Alternative:** EC2 with user data scripts (more control, more management)

3. **Multi-stage Docker Build**
   - **Why:** Smaller production images, better security
   - **Alternative:** Single stage (larger images, more vulnerabilities)

4. **Terraform for Infrastructure**
   - **Why:** Declarative, version-controlled, cloud-agnostic
   - **Alternative:** AWS CLI scripts (imperative, harder to maintain)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Location:** `tests/test_deploy.py`
- **Coverage:** All major functions in deployment script
- **Mocking:** External dependencies (subprocess, network calls)

### Integration Tests
- **Docker Build:** Validates container creation
- **Terraform:** Validates infrastructure configuration
- **GitHub Actions:** Validates CI/CD pipeline syntax

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. Deploy with valid SSH keys
2. Deploy with invalid repository URL
3. Deploy with missing JAR file
4. Deploy with port conflicts
5. Test auto-scaling under load

## üöÄ Production Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites:
1. AWS account with appropriate permissions
2. GitHub repository with SSH access
3. Terraform state backend configured
4. SSH keys stored in AWS Secrets Manager

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Initialize Infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/
   terraform init
   terraform plan -var="environment=production"
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Configure CI/CD:**
   - Set up GitHub secrets for AWS credentials
   - Configure repository SSH keys
   - Push to main branch to trigger deployment

3. **Monitor Deployment:**
   - Check CloudWatch logs for application startup
   - Verify ALB health checks are passing
   - Test application endpoints

### Monitoring and Maintenance:

- **CloudWatch Dashboards:** Monitor CPU, memory, and request metrics
- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Alert on high error rates or resource usage
- **ALB Access Logs:** Analyze traffic patterns and performance
- **Container Insights:** Detailed container-level monitoring

## üîí Security Considerations

### Network Security:
- Private subnets for application containers
- Security groups with minimal required access
- VPC isolation with controlled egress

### Container Security:
- Non-root user execution where possible
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Secrets management via AWS Secrets Manager

### Access Control:
- IAM roles with least privilege principles
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- SSH keys managed as secrets

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Application Level:
- JVM tuning parameters in environment variables
- Health check optimizations
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Infrastructure Level:
- Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory
- Load balancer connection draining
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability

### Cost Optimization:
- Fargate Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- CloudWatch log retention policies
- Resource right-sizing based on usage patterns
