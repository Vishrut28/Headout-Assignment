6. **Rollback:** Automated rollback capability

**Features:**
- Branch-based deployment strategy
- Manual approval for production
- Comprehensive health checks
- Slack notifications
- Artifact management

### 4. Infrastructure (Terraform)

**AWS Resources Created:**

#### Application Load Balancer Configuration

**Parameters Set:**
- **Load Balancer Type:** Application (Layer 7) for HTTP/HTTPS routing
- **Internet-facing:** Public accessibility
- **Cross-zone Load Balancing:** Enabled for even distribution
- **HTTP/2:** Enabled for performance
- **Access Logs:** Enabled for monitoring and debugging
- **Security Groups:** Restrictive ingress (80/443) with full egress

**Parameters Not Set (and why):**
- **SSL Certificate:** Not configured by default (requires domain setup)
- **WAF Integration:** Not included (adds complexity and cost for basic deployment)
- **Custom Domain:** Uses AWS-generated DNS name for simplicity

#### Target Group Configuration

**Health Check Parameters:**
- **Path:** `/health` (assumes Spring Boot Actuator or similar)
- **Interval:** 30 seconds (balance between responsiveness and resource usage)
- **Timeout:** 10 seconds (sufficient for most applications)
- **Healthy Threshold:** 2 checks (quick recovery)
- **Unhealthy Threshold:** 3 checks (avoid false positives)
- **Protocol:** HTTP (suitable for most Java web applications)

**Why These Settings:**
- **30s interval:** Standard AWS recommendation, good balance
- **10s timeout:** Generous for network latency
- **2/3 thresholds:** Quick recovery while avoiding flapping

#### Auto Scaling Configuration

**CPU Scaling:**
- **Target:** 70% utilization
- **Metric:** ECS Service Average CPU
- **Policy Type:** Target Tracking

**Memory Scaling:**
- **Target:** 80% utilization  
- **Metric:** ECS Service Average Memory
- **Policy Type:** Target Tracking

**Why These Thresholds:**
- **CPU 70%:** Allows headroom for traffic spikes
- **Memory 80%:** Higher threshold as memory is more predictable
- **Target Tracking:** Automatically adjusts capacity smoothly

#### ECS Configuration

**Fargate Settings:**
- **CPU:** 1024 units (1 vCPU)
- **Memory:** 2048 MB (2 GB)
- **Network Mode:** awsvpc (required for Fargate)

**Service Configuration:**
- **Desired Count:** 3 (multi-AZ deployment)
- **Deployment:** Rolling update with circuit breaker
- **Service Discovery:** Enabled for internal communication

## üîí Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Private subnets for application containers
- Security groups with minimal required access
- VPC isolation with NAT gateways for outbound access

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution where possible
- SSH keys managed as secrets (not in container images)
- Regular vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)

### Access Management
- IAM roles with least privilege principles
- Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- No hardcoded credentials in code or containers

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### CloudWatch Integration
- **Container Insights:** Enabled for detailed metrics
- **Log Aggregation:** Centralized logging for all containers
- **Custom Metrics:** Application-specific monitoring
- **Alarms:** Automated alerting for critical issues

### Health Checks
- **Load Balancer:** HTTP health checks on `/health`
- **Container:** Docker health check script
- **Application:** Spring Boot Actuator integration (if available)

## üö® Failure Scenarios and Handling

### Common Failure Points

1. **SSH Authentication Failures**
   - **Detection:** SSH connection test during deployment
   - **Handling:** Clear error messages with setup instructions
   - **Recovery:** Manual SSH key configuration required

2. **Repository Access Issues**
   - **Detection:** Git clone failures with specific error codes
   - **Handling:** Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - **Recovery:** Check repository permissions and SSH keys

3. **JAR File Not Found**
   - **Detection:** File existence checks after clone
   - **Handling:** Search for alternative JAR files in repository
   - **Recovery:** Use found JAR files or fail with clear message

4. **Port Already in Use**
   - **Detection:** Port availability check before starting application
   - **Handling:** Attempt to terminate existing processes
   - **Recovery:** Force kill if graceful termination fails

5. **Application Startup Failures**
   - **Detection:** Process monitoring and health checks
   - **Handling:** Capture stdout/stderr for debugging
   - **Recovery:** Automatic restart with backoff strategy

6. **Infrastructure Failures**
   - **Detection:** Terraform state monitoring and AWS API responses
   - **Handling:** Automatic rollback for failed deployments
   - **Recovery:** Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

### Logging Strategy

**Log Levels:**
- **ERROR:** Critical failures requiring immediate attention
- **WARN:** Issues that don't stop operation but need monitoring
- **INFO:** Normal operation status and milestones
- **DEBUG:** Detailed troubleshooting information (disabled in production)

**Log Destinations:**
- **Local Files:** `deployment.log` for script execution
- **CloudWatch:** Centralized logging for container applications
- **ALB Logs:** Access patterns and performance metrics

## üéØ Assumptions and Decisions

### Technical Assumptions

1. **Java Application Structure**
   - JAR file located at `build/libs/project.jar`
   - Application listens on port 9000
   - Health endpoint available at `/health`
   - Standard Spring Boot application structure

2. **GitHub Repository**
   - SSH access configured and functional
   - Repository contains buildable Java project
   - Main/develop branch strategy for deployments
   - Secrets and configuration externalized

3. **AWS Environment**
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
   - ECR repository access for image storage
   - VPC and networking resources can be created
   - S3 bucket for Terraform state management exists

### Design Decisions

   - **Alternative Considered:** EKS (too complex for this use case)
   - **Trade-off:** Less control over underlying infrastructure

2. **Load Balancer: Application Load Balancer**
   - **Why:** Layer 7 routing, better health checks, AWS integration
   - **Alternative Considered:** Network Load Balancer (Layer 4)
   - **Trade-off:** Higher cost but better features for web applications

3. **Infrastructure as Code: Terraform**
   - **Why:** Cloud-agnostic, mature, good state management
   - **Alternative Considered:** CloudFormation (AWS-specific)
   - **Trade-off:** Additional tool complexity vs. vendor lock-in

4. **Base Image: Amazon Corretto Alpine**
   - **Why:** AWS optimized, lightweight, security updates
   - **Alternative Considered:** OpenJDK (less optimized for AWS)
   - **Trade-off:** AWS ecosystem lock-in vs. optimization

5. **Auto Scaling Thresholds**
   - **CPU: 70%** - Conservative to handle traffic spikes
   - **Memory: 80%** - More aggressive as memory usage is predictable
   - **Alternative:** Custom metrics (requires application instrumentation)
